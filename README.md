# BusTrackingSystem
In today’s world, actual record for fuel monitoring such as consumption , and
tracking of vehicle with their exact locations with time stamp both in one could not
maintain correctly! To overcome this problem we are implementing the solution for
handling both fuel monitoring and the tracking of the vehicle with their exact location
such as latitude and longitude; to achieve this we have used GPS Module-NEO-6M, and
Fuel devices which are capable to get the exact data from the vehicle and send to the real
time database system for the further actions; BTFMS , system will store the more number
of vehicles and their data with unique vehicle id which will be provided by the
Managements. To achieve the good interface foe the user we have developed the android
app which can handle both the monitoring of fuel and the location of the vehicle; along
with this we have implemented the unique feature called the Messaging –user can chat or
message in the public for any help he/she might need. This feature not included
anywhere; this will work for their any critical conditions. at any condition they can get
the solution or help. And the android app also include the history of the vehicle – means
that it can collect
all the previous movement with the time stamps so user can get the exact information of
their vehicle.

# GENERAL INTRODUCTION
Among all public transportation services, bus service is the major transportation
used by public. Especially in a busy town or city, bus is the most easy, convenient and
cheaper transportation. Various reasons that people take bus instead of driving own
vehicle such as traffic jam, heavy parking fee and lack of parking slot in destination. in
order to solve these problems and enhance current bus service system, real time bus
tracking system has to develop and implement. With real time bus tracking system, bus
position data is connected real time and transmitted to a central server for processing and
extracting transit information. The main technology used to develop this system is Global
Positioning System (GPS) Basically it consist of GPS device and maintaining android
applications nothing but android app which support mobile device. When the bus starts
it’s journey having GPS with GSM features and connected to the server. Every 5mins
interval the GPS coordinates of the bus is capable of connecting to the server. By the help
of GPS we can access the information with secure through android app and also fuel
monitoring system is also taken with the sensor and hardware components. The frontend
of the system makes uses of android studio IDE with java and script while SQL server as
Backend.
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Tracking and monitoring of bus/vehicle and fuel theft nowadays is also a big problem.
Actual location determination of the vehicle using GPS technique having GSM cellular
network and connection to server. Fuel theft prevention .
Lack of real time platform is the serious communication problem between bus user and
bus management team. Without a real time platform, bus management side unable to
update latest bus traffic information for people. people also cannot check on the updated
bus schedule if there is a bus delay happens. People could not actual location of the bus
and management team so there could a serious problem occurs due to inconveniences
between the people and bus. Another major issue in the bus management team is
monitoring fuel. It’s also a big issue. Because some time the driver couldn’t know about
the fuel information and no physical or indicator is there for fuel monitoring the there
will obviously some critical situations may occur. Fuel detection and reminding to the
driver is also a issue in nowadays bus management system.
# OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
The main objective of the proposed system is to apply GPS tracking technology
into bus transportation system currently operating in UTAR. The proposed system will
install GPS receiver on buses to perform real time position tracking bus during operating
hours. The bus position data will send to central server and process become bus traffic
information which needed to provide for bus users. By this real time position tracking
system, it will increase the accuracy of bus timetable scheduling.
In proposed system, a real time platform is developed between people and bus
management team. With this platform, peoples able to check on real time bus arrival time
for particular bus stop and latest or updated bus traffic information. Moreover, bus
management team able to update latest bus traffic information on time to bus users
through real time platform. And also the actual location of the bus. Compare to current
bus system in UTAR which still posting bus timetable on notice board in paper form, the
proposed system is more effectiveness. Besides, bus tracking system able to reduce major
workload done by bus management team. First of all, real time bus position tracking
system will automatically calculate the arrival time for next bus stop of particular bus.
Second, this system provides a platform allow bus management team to update bus
schedule through Internet. By reducing workload of bus management team, they can
utilize the time in other matters in order to enhance quality of bus service.
Also Rising fuel costs constantly challenge fleet operators to maintain movement
of vehicles and monitor driver behavior to avoid delaying traffic conditions by either,
combining deliveries, reconfiguring routes or rescheduling timetables. This aims to
maximize the number of deliveries while minimizing time and distance. Escalating oil
prices are increasing costs for many businesses, particularly those with large vehicle
fleets, adding a powerful financial impetus to the search for fuel efficiencies.
Implementing real-time vehicle tracking as part of a commercial company’s mobile
resource management policy is essential for comprehensive operational control, remote
driver security and fuel savings.

# PROJECT DELIVERABLES
The end users can avail the bus tracking facility through an Android App which is
basically an interface for the users access live location of the bus, messaging system and
fuel details .All these features are displayed with the help of an android application which
is compatible with all versions of android and the users can access them anywhere at any
time conveniently through their mobile phones
# CURRENT SCOPE
At Present there is a need for a Real Time Bus Tracking system to reduce the anxiety of
passengers and to keep them informed about the availability of buses and their routes
.Also there is a need for Transportation departments across the globe to monitor the
driving habits of the drivers and fuel consumption details of the buses so that they can
keep a check on the fuel and come up with solutions to minimize fuel consumptions and
to analyze the drivers performance and rank them accordingly
# FUTURE SCOPE
There is tremendous scope in our project for performance enhancement by implementing
new features as per the administrator and customer requirements . Currently we have
implemented a messaging service which enables the passengers to communicate with the
administrators in case of any inconvenience or issues related to commuting , we can
improve this feature by coming up with new innovative solutions . We can design and
develop prediction models to predict the fuel consumptions across various routes leading
to a particular destination and figure out the optimal route that has to be taken to mitigate
fuel consumption . There is a scope to make use of advanced computing techniques like
Machine Learning and Computer Vision to achieve smart and innovative methodologies
which can be implemented in our project and deployable to the customers in the market.
